# SentimentStyleNLPBot: Advanced Chatbot for Sentiment and Style Analysis

## Project Overview

This chatbot is the culmination of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for CS 421, designed to provide sophisticated text analysis through a comprehensive approach to language understanding.

### Code Implementation
- `ChatBot.py`: Main chatbot implementation
- `process_transcripts.py`: Transcript processing utilities

## Project Phases

### Part 1: Sentiment Classification
- Developed a machine learning model to predict sentiment (positive/negative)
- Implemented text representation techniques
- Utilized classification algorithms

### Part 2: Stylistic Analysis
- Extracted meaningful text features using NLTK
- Analyzed linguistic nuances and micro-expressions
- Implemented custom feature extractors with focus on:
  - Grammatical dependency relations
  - Text complexity metrics
  - Linguistic structural information

### Part 3: Dialogue Management
- Implemented a finite-state dialogue architecture
- Integrated sentiment and stylistic analysis
- Created interactive chatbot interface

## Technical Components

### Key Features
- Sentiment Classification
- Stylistic Feature Extraction
- Interactive Dialogue Management

### Technologies and Libraries
- Python 3.6+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Stanford CoreNLP

## Stylistic Analysis Techniques

### Feature Extraction Methods
1. Type-Token Ratio (TTR)
2. Average Tokens per Sentence
3. Grammatical Dependency Parsing
4. Custom Feature Extractors
   - Linguistic structure analysis
   - Text complexity measurement

## Dialogue States
- Welcome State
- Name Collection State
- Sentiment Analysis State
- Stylistic Analysis State

## Evaluation Methodology

### Coherence Analysis
- TAACO (Tool for Automatic Analysis of Cohesion)
- Metrics for dialogue quality assessment

### Usability Evaluation
- User interaction studies
- Survey based on DARPA Communicator project metrics
- Assessments of:
  1. Interaction clarity
  2. System predictability
  3. Dialogue naturalness

## Future Improvements
- Advanced NLP techniques
- Enhanced dialogue management
- More sophisticated feature extraction
- Expanded linguistic analysis capabilities

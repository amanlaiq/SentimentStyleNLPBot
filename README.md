SentimentStyleNLPBot: Advanced Chatbot for Sentiment and Style Analysis

This repository hosts the development of a specialized chatbot designed as part of the CS 421 course project at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The chatbot is engineered to analyze and interpret the sentiment and style of natural language input, providing valuable insights into user communications. The project is structured into three main deliverables:

Language Representation: Utilizing advanced techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec to convert text into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Text Classification: Implementing and comparing various statistical machine learning models to accurately predict the sentiment of user input as positive or negative.
Integration and Testing: Combining the models and representations into a fully functional chatbot that can be interacted with in real-time.
This project showcases the application of theoretical knowledge in practical, real-world systems and aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with current machine learning technologies in natural language processing.
